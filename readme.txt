This plugin will give you the option to add random label in the admin panel or on the front panel to indicate if this is staging (development) environment or live (production) one.

== Description ==

How many times have you worked on the staging of a site and realizing at some point that this is not the development environment? 

This plugin will give you the options to add a random (by your choice) text label which might appear in the WordPress admin bar or on the front end. You will be provided with the following settings:
* Set your own text for label (instead of the default \"This is Staging\")
* Choose the label to be visible on the front end, admin bar, both or nowhere (but then why you gonna need this)
* Pick up the color of the background and the font for the front end
* Choose the location of the label on the front end (left-top; left-bottom; right-top; right-bottom)
* Add the King Leonidas\'s face on the front end label (or don\'t add it)
* Set the visibility (you can keep the label visible only for you, admin role or array a list of users\' ids)

To access the settigns page go to Settings->This is staging.
